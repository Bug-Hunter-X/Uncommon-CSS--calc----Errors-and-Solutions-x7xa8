The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, using it incorrectly can lead to unexpected results. For example, omitting spaces between operators and operands, or using invalid units, can cause the calculation to fail silently or produce incorrect values. Another common mistake is nesting `calc()` expressions improperly, which might also lead to unexpected outputs. Finally, using `calc()` with incompatible units (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages without proper conversion) may lead to errors.
